# About Me

Hi! I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at [the School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), Nanjing University. My major is Electronic Information Science and Technology. However, I am very interested in the field of integrated circuits, so I have taken almost all the courses related to integrated circuit design and integrated systems at Nanjing University. <br />
<br />
Next year, I will be going to the [Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for my Ph.D, under the guidance of Professor [Wei Zhang](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eeweiz). My research interests lie in digital IC design, computer architecture, and AI chips.  <br />

# News

[2024-3-15] My first journal paper 'Design of an Analogue Modulation Parameter Measuring System for Radio Signals' has been accepted to Chinese Core Journal "[Foreign Electronic Measurement Technology](http://femt.etmchina.com/femt/home)". This is also my first first-author paper!<br />

[2023-11-13] I build me own homepage! I'll try to improve the content of my homepage in the future!<br />

# Collaboration  

I am always open to collaborative opportunities that can contribute to our understanding and capabilities as well as coming up with novel ideas to push the boundaries of technology.  <br />
I am exploring potential research directions for my future studies, so I am eager to engage with more knowledge. Currently, my research interests mainly include:  <br />

1. AI computing architecture design for edge computing (AI chip design and algorithm-hardware co-optimization)   <br />
2. High-performance digital chip design   <br />
3. Computer Architecture  <br />
4. Reconfigurable computing (FPGA, CGRA)   <br />
5. Computing In Memory   <br />
<br />
