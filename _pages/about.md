# About Me

Hi! I am currently a first year Ph.D. student [Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the guidance of Professor [Wei Zhang](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eeweiz). My research interests lie in digital IC design, computer architecture, and FPGA-based accelerator design.<br />
<br />
I got my Bs.c. degree at [the School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), Nanjing University in 2024. And my major is Electronic Information Science and Technology.<br />

# News

[2024-3-15] My first journal paper 'Design of an Analogue Modulation Parameter Measuring System for Radio Signals' has been accepted to Chinese Core Journal "[Foreign Electronic Measurement Technology](http://femt.etmchina.com/femt/home)". This is also my first first-author paper!<br />

[2023-11-13] I build me own homepage! I'll try to improve the content of my homepage in the future!<br />

# Collaboration  

I am always open to collaborative opportunities that can contribute to our understanding and capabilities as well as coming up with novel ideas to push the boundaries of technology.  <br />
I am exploring potential research directions for my future studies, so I am eager to engage with more knowledge. Currently, my research interests mainly include:  <br />

1. High-performance Digital Chip Design   <br />
2. FPGA-based Accelerator Design   <br />
3. Electronic Design Automation Algorithm
4. Computer Architecture  <br />
<br />
